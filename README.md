## About

I don't build demos. I build systems that run.

9th-semester CS & AI student at Universidad Sergio Arboleda, working at the intersection of machine learning engineering, distributed data infrastructure, and autonomous AI systems. My stack runs on real AWS infrastructure and a Linux workstation — not just notebooks.

```python
julian = {
    "focus":    ["ML Engineering", "Data Engineering", "Autonomous Agents", "Stochastic Systems"],
    "building": [

## Featured Projects

### 🧠 [Jarvis IronMan](https://github.com/Julian-Rincon/Jarvis-Public) — Production AI Assistant `🟢 Active`

> Production-grade personal AI assistant running daily on Linux (Fedora KDE). Streaming voice conversation with sub-second response and barge-in interrupt.

**TieredBrain:** 3-level LLM routing (Ollama local → Groq → Gemini) with circuit breakers and shared context. 16 auto-discovered skills. Iron Man web HUD with live system metrics. Meeting agent that joins Meet/Zoom/Teams, transcribes live, and speaks through a virtual microphone. Autonomous desktop vision agent (up to 25 steps). Full Google Workspace integration (Calendar, Gmail, Drive). Vector + episodic memory (ChromaDB). Daily OS layer (morning briefing, day close, productivity metrics). Gaming mode with automatic GPU/thermal management. Telegram remote control, voice-first.

### 🏠 [SAVI v2 — Autonomous Real Estate Valuation](https://github.com/Julian-Rincon/ames-housing-ml) · [Live Demo](https://julian-rincon.github.io/ames-housing-ml/SAVI_v2_ParcialFinal.html) `🟢 Active`

> Architected a full Reinforcement Learning pipeline that moves beyond price prediction into autonomous risk-based decision making. Three RL agents trained in sequence — consensus policy determines the final APPROVE / REVIEW / REJECT verdict.

**Pipeline:** `K-Means segmentation → XGBoost pricing (R²=0.9609) → MDP Value Iteration (259 iter) → Q-Learning tabular (8K episodes) → Double DQN PyTorch (150 epochs) → Consensus policy`

**Results:** 93.1% auto-approved · 6.9% escalated · IEEE technical paper delivered

### 🛒 [ShopStream — AWS Big Data Pipeline](https://github.com/Julian-Rincon/shopstream-bigdata) `✅ Done`

> Engineered a production-grade end-to-end data pipeline for a fictional e-commerce platform on AWS. Every layer is instrumented, tested, and deployed via CI/CD.

**Architecture:** `Python datagen (2.5M events) → S3 partitioned storage → Lambda validator (CloudWatch metrics + quarantine) → EMR/PySpark (6 analytics KPIs + anomaly detection) → Glue ETL → RDS PostgreSQL DWH → Flask API via Zappa`

**Engineering details:** 86% test coverage · GitHub Actions CI/CD · security group hardening on RDS

### 🎲 Project Dogma — Stochastic Social Propagation Engine `✅ Done`

> Built a mathematically rigorous simulation of ideological propagation across an urban social graph. Four distinct mathematical models govern every layer of the system.

**Mathematical architecture:**
- **Dynamic Markov Chains** — agent state transitions (Neutral → Believer → Fanatic) modulated by solitude, skepticism, and charisma variables
- **Hidden Markov Model (Forward algorithm)** — authority behavior inferred from latent states via observable Heat entropy signal
- **Verhulst Logistic Differential Equation** — resource carrying capacity K generating natural S-curve propagation
- **Nash Equilibrium (2×2 mixed strategy, 55%/45%)** — schism resolution eliminating dominant pure strategies

**Validation:** 500 Monte Carlo simulations · μ=152 ticks · conversion 5.42 agents/tick (σ=0.39) · retention ratio 38:1
